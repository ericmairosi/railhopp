# Network Rail Feeds Implementation - Complete! üöÑ

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive Network Rail data feeds integration for your Railhopp application. This provides real-time access to all major Network Rail data sources.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **All Major Network Rail Data Feeds**

- **MOVEMENT** - Real-time train position updates and movement events
- **TD (Train Describer)** - Berth-level train tracking and signaling data
- **TSR (Temporary Speed Restrictions)** - Active speed restrictions affecting the network
- **VSTP (Very Short Term Planning)** - Dynamic schedule changes and updates
- **RTPPM (Real Time Public Performance Measure)** - Performance metrics and punctuality data
- **CORPUS** - Complete location reference data with station mappings
- **SMART** - Berth offset data for precise train positioning

### 2. **API Endpoints**

- `/api/network-rail` - Main aggregator endpoint with unified data access
- `/api/network-rail/tsr` - Temporary speed restrictions data
- `/api/network-rail/rtppm` - Performance metrics and analytics
- `/api/network-rail-status` - Enhanced system status with Network Rail info

### 3. **Real-time Architecture**

- **Feeds Aggregator Service** - Combines all feeds into unified data stream
- **STOMP Connection Handling** - Real-time message processing from Network Rail
- **Data Quality Monitoring** - Tracks feed health and message rates
- **Intelligent Caching** - Optimizes API performance and reduces load

### 4. **Configuration & Setup**

- Environment variables for Network Rail credentials
- Setup CLI integration (`npm run setup`)
- Automated service initialization
- Comprehensive testing suite (`npm run test:network-rail`)

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables (in `.env.local`)

```env
# Network Rail Open Data Feeds Configuration
NETWORK_RAIL_USERNAME=your_network_rail_username
NETWORK_RAIL_PASSWORD=your_network_rail_password
NETWORK_RAIL_STOMP_URL=stomp://publicdatafeeds.networkrail.co.uk:61618
NETWORK_RAIL_API_URL=https://publicdatafeeds.networkrail.co.uk
NETWORK_RAIL_ENABLED=true
```

### Getting Network Rail Credentials

1. Visit: https://publicdatafeeds.networkrail.co.uk/
2. Register for an account
3. Request access to data feeds
4. Update your `.env.local` with credentials

## üöÄ Usage

### Setup Command

```bash
npm run setup
# Choose option 3: "Setup Network Rail Feeds"
```
